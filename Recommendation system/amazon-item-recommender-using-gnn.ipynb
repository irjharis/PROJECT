{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OhnqKr8wqd80"},"source":["## Title: Graph-Based Recommendation System for Electronic Products\n","\n","### Objective\n","The primary goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system for electronic products using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By leveraging user-product interaction data, the system aims to predict user ratings for products they have not yet rated, thus providing personalized recommendations.\n","\n","### Data Description\n","The dataset used in this project is a CSV file (amazon-product-reviews) containing the following columns:\n","- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.\n","- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.\n","- `rating`: The rating given by the user to the product.\n","- `time_stamp`: The time when the rating was provided.\n","\n","### Methodology\n","1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n","   - Handle missing values.\n","   - Encode `user_id` and `product_id` using Label Encoding.\n","   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.\n","\n","2. **Graph Construction**:\n","   - Define nodes as users and items.\n","   - Create edges based on user-item interactions (ratings).\n","   - Represent the graph using multi-dimensional arrays (torch.tensor) to handle memory efficiently.\n","\n","3. **Model Development**:\n","   - Choose a suitable GNN architecture (e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, or Graph Attention Networks) I use GCN\n","   - Implement the GCN model using PyTorch Geometric.\n","   - Train and validate the model using the constructed graph data.\n","\n","4. **Evaluation**:\n","   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.\n","\n","\n","### Challenges\n","- Managing large datasets with limited computational resources.\n","- Ensuring efficient data preprocessing and graph construction.\n","- Selecting the appropriate GNN architecture and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.\n","\n","### Conclusion\n","The project demonstrates the application of GNNs in building an effective recommendation system for electronic products. By capturing complex user-item interaction patterns, the model provides personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DYTuj4cTriBJ"},"source":["## 1.
